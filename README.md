# Introduction to Programming
## Using File I/O

### Level 1: Saving

Take one of the programs you have written before and adapt it so that you can save the objects to file and load them in again. It is up to you what format the file itself is in, but you might consider having a line for each object, with the different fields separated by a particular character (e.g. a colon).

### Level 2: Loading

When loading things in you could use a _Scanner_ or a _BufferedReader_ to get input a line at a time. Recreate a collection of objects when loading, calling the constructor each time you find a new object in the file, and then adding it to the collection.

### Level 3: Menu

Define a main method which offers you a menu of options, including loading and saving, adding and removing data via the keyboard. When writing a menu-based system take care not to have too much code duplication: cutting and pasting is very tempting in the short term but very costly in the medium term. Use data structures, methods and loops to represent and render your menus.
